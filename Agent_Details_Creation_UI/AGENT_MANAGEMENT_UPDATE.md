## Updated Agent Management System

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed MOCK_AGENTS**: The system now reads agents from localStorage instead of using mock data.

2. **Updated fetchYourAgents.js**: 
   - Now contains the complete AgentDataManager class
   - Reads agents from localStorage in the correct format
   - Converts between localStorage format and internal format
   - Handles both array and object formats from localStorage
   - Updates localStorage when agents are modified or deleted

3. **Updated saveNewAgentBtn.js**:
   - Now correctly formats agent URLs with proper encoding
   - Updates localStorage when new agents are created
   - Refreshes the agent display automatically

4. **Agent URL Format**:
   - Now uses: `http://localhost:3001/chat_agent?agentId=${agentId}&agentName=${encodedAgentName}`
   - Properly encodes agent names for URL safety

### localStorage Data Structure Expected:

The system expects agents in localStorage under the key `agentsList` in this format:

```json
[
  {
    "agentId": "AGT-be300b5d6b4e4701",
    "agentName": "TechSolutions Pro",
    "companyName": "TechSolutions Inc.",
    "companyDescription": "Company description here",
    "companyEmail": "contact@techsolutions.com",
    "companyHumanServiceNumber": "78645599",
    "companyOwnerName": "Sarah Johnson",
    "establishmentDate": "2025-08-19T00:00:00.000Z",
    "items": [
      {
        "itemName": "Customer Data Processing Suite",
        "itemCode": "CDPS-2025",
        "itemInitialWorkingExplanation": "Description of the service",
        "itemRunningSteps": [
          "Step 1",
          "Step 2"
        ],
        "commonProblemsSolutions": [
          {
            "problem": "Issue description",
            "solution": "Solution description"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### How It Works:

1. **On page load**: System reads from localStorage and converts to internal format
2. **"Your Agents" button**: Fetches fresh data from server and updates localStorage
3. **Create/Edit agents**: Updates localStorage and refreshes display
4. **Delete agents**: Removes from localStorage and refreshes display

### Key Features:

- ✅ Automatically loads agents from localStorage on page refresh
- ✅ Syncs with server when "Your Agents" button is clicked
- ✅ Maintains data persistence across browser sessions
- ✅ Handles both array and object formats from localStorage
- ✅ Proper URL encoding for agent names
- ✅ Real-time updates when agents are created/modified/deleted
